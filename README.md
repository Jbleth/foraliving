# For a Living Project
#### This repo will house the website for the "For a Living" project

	* Please run the following commands before...:
		* pip install django-user-accounts
		* pip install pinax-theme-bootstrap
		* pip install metron
		For Postress
			* pip install psycopg2
			* There are multiple ways of getting postgres installed but Djangogirls has a great tutorial if you need any guidance:
				* https://djangogirls.gitbooks.io/django-girls-tutorial-extensions/content/optional_postgresql_installation/

	* Please note that we have since started using posgress as our database of choice. In order to succesfully run this project on your local host you will have to modify the settings.py file (can be found in foraliving_project) to provide the correct credentials. 
		* For you convinience the settings for the sqlite db lines were simply commented out.
